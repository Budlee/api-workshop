# API Workshop

In this workshop we will explore building APIs using Spring Boot.
Building APIs using Spring and other tooling can be done by clicking a couple of buttons. 

However as with any process (regardless of speed) we want to ensure quality in the product we are building.
The workshop is a mixture of hands on exercises and taught mini sessions to introduce the concepts behind building quality APIs.

## Prerequisites 

There are some steps that should be followed before attending the workshop which include
* IDE installed (Intellij/Eclipse) 
* Docker setup

Please visit the [prerequisite](prerequisite/README.md) page to perform these steps
