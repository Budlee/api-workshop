#API Workshop

In this workshop we will explore building APIs using Spring Boot and will see that building 
APIs is incredibly easy. 
However as with any process (regardless of speed) we want to ensure quality in the product we are building.
The workshop is a mixture of hands on exercises and taught mini sessions to introduce the concepts.
