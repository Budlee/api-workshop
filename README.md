# API Workshop

In this workshop we will explore building APIs using Spring Boot.
Building APIs using Spring and other tooling can be done by clicking a couple of buttons.  
However as with any process (regardless of speed) we want to ensure quality in the product we are building.
The workshop is a mixture of hands on exercises and taught mini sessions to introduce the concepts behind building quality APIs.
